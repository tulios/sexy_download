= Sexy_download

Script that retrieves google chrome cookies and calls aria2c for multithreading download

== Usage

1 - Create a syslink for bin/sexy_download in /usr/local/bin/
2 - Run

  sexy_download http://someStorageService.com?q=MVGHT ~/My/Download/Path
  
== Considerations

  - I just tested this script with MAC OSX
  - I just use Google Chrome
  - I download most of my files with megaUpload using a paid account (It works with other services too)
  - My better result was 3.5 mb/s
  - I just solved my problem and maybe one day I will improve this script ;)
